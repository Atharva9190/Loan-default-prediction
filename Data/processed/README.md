# Processed Data

This folder contains the **cleaned and preprocessed dataset** used for model training in the Loan Default Prediction project.

## 📂 Contents
- `loan_data_processed.csv` — Cleaned dataset ready for analysis and modelling.
  - All missing values handled.
  - Irrelevant or leakage columns removed.
  - Encoded categorical features.
  - Created engineered features like FICO average score.

## 🛠 Processing Steps
The preprocessing pipeline includes:
1. **Data Cleaning** — Removed duplicates, handled missing values.
2. **Feature Selection** — Kept only relevant predictors.
3. **Feature Engineering** — Created new features (e.g., FICO average score).
4. **Encoding** — Converted categorical features into numeric.
5. **Imbalance Handling** — Applied SMOTE/ADASYN during model training (not stored here).

## ⚠️ Note
The processed dataset is generated by running the preprocessing script:
```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
