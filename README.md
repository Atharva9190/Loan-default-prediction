# Loan Defaulter Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts **loan defaulters** â€” borrowers likely to default â€” using historical applicant and loan information.  
By analysing past financial and demographic data, the model identifies **high-risk borrowers** before approval, helping lenders reduce credit losses.

## ðŸ“Š Problem Statement
- **Objective:** Detect borrowers at **risk of default** before loan approval.
- **Positive class:** **Defaulter** (minority class in the dataset).
- **Business goal:** Maximise **Recall on defaulters** (catch as many risky borrowers as possible) while keeping Precision acceptable.
- **Challenge:** The dataset is highly imbalanced (few defaulters vs many non-defaulters), which can bias models toward predicting only non-defaulters.
